# Hi there 👋


### 😎 About Me
🤓 I am Christopher Villanueva, a Sophomore student at RPI pursuing my Bachelors's Degree in Computer Science. Over the last few years, I have delved into multiple programming languages primarily focused on back-end development.

💻 Some skills I am proficient in include C++, C#, Java, Python, Linux, Vim/Nvim, and more.
🎮 Outside of programming, I find myself playing video games with friends, playing Golf, and watching/reading One Piece 👒.
