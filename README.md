# Hi there ðŸ‘‹


### ðŸ˜Ž About Me
ðŸ¤“ I am Christopher Villanueva, a Sophomore student at RPI pursuing my Bachelors's Degree in Computer Science. Over the last few years, I have delved into multiple programming languages primarily focused on back-end development.

ðŸ’» Some skills I am proficient in include C++, C#, Java, Python, Linux, Vim/Nvim, and more.

ðŸŽ® Outside of programming, I find myself playing video games with friends, playing Golf, and watching/reading One Piece ðŸ‘’.
